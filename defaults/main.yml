# List with dicts with netconfig settings. Every element describes a file line.
#
# Entries in the file have the following format:
#
# network_id semantics flags protofamily protoname device libraries
#
# Dictionary elements consist of the following fields (all required):
#
# - network_id:   The name of the transport
#   semantics:    Semantics of the transport. This can be one of:
#                   tpi_clts -> Connectionless transport
#                   tpi_cots -> Connection-oriented transport
#                   tpi_cots_ord ->Connection-oriented, ordered transport
#                   tpi_raw -> A raw connection
#   flags:        This field is either blank, specified by "-" o "v", meaning
#                 visible to the getnetconfig(3) function
#   protofamily:  Protocol family of the transport. This is currently one of:
#                   inet6 -> The IPv6 (PF_INET6 ) family of protocols
#                   inet -> The IPv4 (PF_INET ) family of protocols
#                   loopback -> The PF_LOCAL protocol family
#   protoname:    Name of the protocol used for this transport. Can be either
#                 udp, tcp or empty
#   device:       Always empty in current versions of libtirpc
#   libraries:    Always empty in current versions of libtirpc
#
# Empty values mean '-'.
